# Funkin Unity

## A w.i.p. port of Friday Night Funkin' to the Unity Game Engine!

This is a project by little ol me, completely made out of boredom.
This will NEVER be perfect (I sucks at codings).
If you wanna help with this please. please do.

## Uses Unity 2020.1.0b4

## Todo:

Somehow convert fnf charts to sprites for the engine to load in or sumn.
Fix the code that handles BF's animations.
Make the code not weird lookin. (Clean the code.)
Make a thingy that shows what's new (kinda like how KE does it!)
